does vertical landing of a rocket require learning? in light of additional source of documentation this video summarising learning to fly a helicopter, and control engineering in more general terms.

"for a computer, the problem is, 10 times a second, you're told where the helicopter is, and you need to figure out how to move all those control sticks to keep the helicopter balanced."
-> from the falcon 9 video, it looks like you're given status data at a much lower frequency. so maybe that's a non learning-related fix that's needed.
-> but it probably makes it much harder that the rocket is so huge, can't use friction with air to absorb a miscalculated movement. maybe that should be learned?

3:50 "it is too complicated for an engineer to write out a mathematical specification of the aerodynamics of a helicopter"
-> so you have to learn them.
-> but maybe aerodynamics of a big fat vertical thrust rocket are actually simple?

Ryan Adams, Harvard: Bayesian optimization of NNs

is.gd/xYvwto

consider objective function which to all params or just the hyperparams of the NN, 
assigns the NNs final validation or test error
-> v expensive objective function to evaluate

can form beliefs about what this objective function might be
-> for any set of hyparams, think of distribution of cost aka obj function's value
-> this distrib could be a gaussian process

then choose next point of objective to evaluate so as to:
a) exploit: pick point which maximises expected cost, or
b) explore: pick point which most reduces uncertainty

what's good?
-> global optimisation
-> nonparametric
-> expected cost function is also nonconvex, but its easier to evaluate than objective
function

so where's the weakness? 
-> extent of smoothness prior on gaussian process
   -> too smooth, dont assign enough prob to true objective function
   -> not smooth enough, converge too slowly
-> so maybe should form beliefs on what appropriate smoothness assumption should be
   ie go full bayesian
